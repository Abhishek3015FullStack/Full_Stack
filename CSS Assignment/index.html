                                        Block-level elements have the default width of 100% of the webpage, so for centering the block element,
                                        we need space around it. So for generating the space, we are giving it a width.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li  > <b> Step 2: </b> Set the left-margin and the right-margin of the element to auto -
                                        Since we produced a remaining space by providing external width so now we need to align that space
                                        properly that's why we should use margin property. Margin is a property that tells how to align a
                                        remaining space. So for centering the element you must set left-margin to auto and right-margin to auto.
